they can even learn something that
that they have never heard of before </p></center>

<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><font size="6"><center><p style="color:#F6A8F3;">3. Children like learning things as long as you make it fun. Make it interesting and maybe even amusing. Try making
it into a game or a puzzle.</p></center>

master it.</p></center>
